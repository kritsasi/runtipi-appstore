## Installation Notes ##

Before starting OpenFlow, ensure that MongoDB and RabbitMQ credentials are set correctly in Tipiâ€™s App configuration form.  
If you plan to access OpenFlow externally (outside your private network), enable the **"Expose app"** option and configure a public URL in Tipi.  
These settings can be updated later if you decide to integrate agents or services that require public access.
